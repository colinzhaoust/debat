1.2. DEBATE ROUNDS 
=====================

The interaction with other children at this age, and learning to manage those relationships, learning from other adults with different teaching styles, and resolving conflict, all provided an important base of experience that each one leveraged after preschool. The preschool's curriculum proved to be less relevant. Both of my children's development was accelerated by their preschool experience, and the timing of their experiences was critical to that growth."}, # comment text

A positive experience at preschool can really help make a comfortable transition for a child by lessening the fears of the unknown.'}],

Preschool doesn't give children a significant advantage in their following year, nor in their later years.  \n  \r\nI don't know where we get this mentality that we need to make transitions easier for children. Or, that we need to lessen the fear factor for children. Doing one or both of these things in fact hurts children by not preparing them. The world is in fact a scary place, and the fear of going to school for the first time is the last thing about which parents should be concerned.  \n  \r\nI also don't think parents should be so willing to part with their young child just so the mother can aquire resources and/or networking."},

				    'text': "\n  \r\nYes, of course these things could be accomplished in 1st grade but most schools have an expectation that a child will come to first grade with these basic skills allowing them to focus on reading and other core fundamentals. If a child is not adjusted to spending time away from his mother or does not know how to play with other children, the child will fall behind not only in learning but will also not know how to establish friendships with other children. We all know that children can be tough on each other. It is important early on for a child to establish bonds with their classmates. No one wants to be the kid that is picked last to play ball. This can have a serious negative impact on the child that will live with him throughout his school years and the rest of his life. ..."}],
